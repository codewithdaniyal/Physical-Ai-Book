# Chapter 3: Leading Humanoids

The theory of Physical AI is now being put into practice. Several companies are racing to build the first "general-purpose" humanoid robot. These are not movie props; they are real machines being tested in factories today.

## 1. Tesla Optimus (Gen 2)

Announced by Elon Musk, Optimus is designed to be a mass-manufactured robot for dangerous or boring tasks.

* **Design Philosophy:** "Biologically inspired." It uses actuators designed to mimic human muscles and proprietary sensing hands.
* **Key Feature:** It runs on the same AI stack as Tesla's self-driving cars (FSD). It learns by watching humans perform tasks (video imitation learning).
* **Goal:** To cost less than $20,000 and be available for home use.

## 2. Boston Dynamics Atlas

Atlas is the most famous dynamic robot. For years, the hydraulic version performed backflips and parkour.

* **The Pivot:** In 2024, Boston Dynamics retired the hydraulic Atlas and released a **Fully Electric Atlas**.
* **Capabilities:** It has a wider range of motion than a human (e.g., its head can spin 360 degrees).
* **Focus:** Heavy industrial work and logistics.

## 3. Figure AI (Figure 01 & 02)

Figure AI made headlines by partnering with OpenAI.

* **The "Brain":** It uses OpenAI's vision-language models to speak and understand context in real-time.
* **Demo:** In a famous demo, a human asked Figure 01 for something to eat, and the robot identified an apple, picked it up, and handed it over—while explaining *why* it did so.
* **Commercial Use:** They have already signed a deal with BMW to deploy robots in car manufacturing plants.

## Comparison of Leading Humanoids

| Feature | Tesla Optimus | Electric Atlas | Figure 02 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Actuation** | Electric | Electric | Electric |
| **Primary AI** | Visual Imitation (Tesla) | Control Theory + AI | OpenAI (GPT-4o) |
| **Hand Dexterity** | High (11 DoF) | High | High |
| **Target Market** | General / Home | Heavy Industry | Warehousing / Auto |

## Conclusion

We are witnessing the "Cambrian Explosion" of robotics. Just as the internet changed how we handle information, these humanoids will change how we handle matter. The journey of learning Physical AI starts here.
